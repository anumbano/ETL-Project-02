# ETL-Project-02
Project 02: ETL Pipeline with Python, Pandas & MySQL

This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and MySQL.

Extract → Read raw data from an Excel/CSV file.

Transform → Cleaned data with Pandas (handled missing values, applied grouping, sorting, aggregations).

Load → Loaded the transformed data into a MySQL database table using SQLAlchemy + PyMySQL.

 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, MySQL, CSV
 Goal: Understand end-to-end ETL workflow and practice loading data into a relational database for analytics.
